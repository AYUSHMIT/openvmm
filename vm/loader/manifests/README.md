This folder contains different manifest recipes to build various IGVM files.
These contain the functional configuration for a given igvm recipe.

The build system will automatically create the required resource file used by
this tool.

If you want to run this tool manually and specify a custom resource file, see
igvmfilegen_config's `Resources` type and usage on how to manually create a
resource file for a given recipe.
